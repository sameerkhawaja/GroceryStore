# GroceryStore
Currently the grocery store accepts a List<string> for the items that are going to be purchased.
To change what items are going to be evaluated in the shopping cart, edit the Program.cs file and add the string to the collection shown here

var items = new List<string>
            {
                StoreInventoryConstants.Apple,
                StoreInventoryConstants.Apple,
                StoreInventoryConstants.Orange,
                StoreInventoryConstants.Apple
            };
